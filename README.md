# Project 4 - *Tweeter*

**Tweeter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss how to use closures better.
2. I would like to discuss how to implement delegates into our app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A lot of the syntax was different between the video and the options that Xcode as actually giving me.  I had to figure out and play around with the method signatures to get the right methods that I wanted.  For example, with regards to the JSONSerialization methods, I accidentally swapped the methods I actually needed.
Furthermore, there was a bug with the video series, since a few TAs also had this bug. I logged in, logged out and then closed the app.  Afterwards the app would crash. One TA helped me and we fixed the bug by adding a guard let statment to check if currentUserData is nil before attempting to grab the data.

# Project 5 - *Tweeter*

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Tweet Details Page: User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.
- [x] Profile page:
   - [x] Contains the user header view
   - [x] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [x] Home Timeline: Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page
- [x] Compose Page: User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] When composing, you should have a countdown in the upper right for the tweet limit.
- [ ] After creating a new tweet, a user should be able to view it in the timeline immediately without refetching the timeline from the network.
- [ ] Profile Page
   - [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. The tap recognizer is pretty confusing.
2. I would like to know how to better use segues as well.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I thought that creating the gestureRecognizer and having the segue run when the imageView was tapped was very tricky.  I found a discussions post about it, which helped me a lot.
